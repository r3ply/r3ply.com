## A Commenting System as Simple as Email

r3ply makes adding comments to your website easy by allowing your readers to submit them via email. This allows readers to comment with signing up for, yet another, account, while also allowing site's to moderate their content.

I made r3ply because I wanted to a commenting system for [my own website](https://spenc.es/) that was flexible for myself and my site's visitors. r3ply integrates well with both static and dynamic website sites.

To see a demo of r3ply, and learn more about how it works, check out the [the post](https://spenc.es/writing/email-as-a-commenting-system/) where I introduce it.

## Features:
* User's can submit comments to your site via email
* Email addresses are automatically redacted before being published
* Comments can be reviewed before they going live
* Modular design means bring your own build (or backend)

!["Screen recording of using r3ply"](screenrecording_md.webp "Your email client is probably a lot nicer for writing than the browser. For example, drafts are automatically saved and you can scroll through the article as you think abobut you're writing.")

## Benefits:
1. Everyone already has email!
2. Good balance between UX and moderating spam or offensive content
3. Email gives you for free a lot of useful features that you don't have to build:
    * Draft comments that can be saved and resumed later
    * Comment history in the form of their archive
    * Emails are naturally threaded
    * A robust text editor that's already battle tested
    * Some degree of prebuilt spam detection
    * Users can scroll through content while they prepare their draft

### What about privacy?
Emails addresses are automatically converted to private but unique hashes before comments are published.

### Can people choose a "nickname" to associate with a comment?
In the future, maybe. I'm thinking about adding a feature that will allow people to optionally sign their emails with a nickname they'd like shown next to their comment.

### How do I integrate r3ply with my at site?
For the time being, I just just have a GitHub "integration" built, for my own site's needs, however in the future further integrations can be built and you can also easily author your own and expose a webhook.

### How does content moderation work?
If moderation is enabled, site owners will be notified when new comments have been received, where they can approve or reject submissions, as well as block malicious users.

### Where does r3ply run?
The inbound email portion of r3ply currently uses [Cloudflare‚Äôs email workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) to run. Its resource requirements fits comfortably within their free tier.

### What if I want to run r3ply on my own infrastructure?
If you want to bring r3ply to some other infrastructure then great! [contact me](https://spenc.es/contact/) and let‚Äôs talk more about it.

### Is there a managed version of it?
Currently no, but if it becomes popular then maybe a service could be made out of it.

### How does r3ply know from an email where a comment should go on my site?
r3ply uses information in the subject line of the email to embed where a comment is intended to go.

### How does this subject line get in the email to begin with?
When the use clicks a ‚Äúcomment‚Äù button, they‚Äôre actually clicking a mailto link that pre-populates the necessary information.

### What is included in the mailto links?
It includes the sender, as well as instructions that are in the email body. However, most importantly is the subject line which includes what the comment is replying as well as hash designed to prevent tampering.

### How does this mailto link get generated?
Your site needs to build it.

### What prevents a malicious user from tampering with the subject line?
r3ply will compare a hash of the subject line to a precomputed one, and if they differ it will reject the email.

### How do emails help with moderation?
Because if users spam or are otherwise malicious then their email address can be blocked.

### Can‚Äôt they just use another email address?
Yes, but then that one can be blocked too, and using multiple email addresses is a problem for traditional account signups as well.

### Do users receive a notification that their comment was successfully submitted?
Yes, currently r3ply will auto reply to their email notifying them that their comment has been received.
